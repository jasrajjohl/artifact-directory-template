Title:
ForumRec - A Question Recommender for the Super User Community

Abstract:
ForumRec is a recommendation system that works with the Super User forum of the stack exchange forum website. Through the Stack Apps API we are able to gather the recent questions that come from the Super User forum website and determine through our data model, which users of ours are best equipped to answer those questions. ForumRec is built using a model that combines content-based and collaborative filtering techniques from the LightFM package to identify how well a novel question would fit for the desired user. This system we developed aims to increase usability for the forumâ€™s participants by specifically recommending questions that may be more suitable for a user in particular to answer.
